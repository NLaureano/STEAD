# SeismoCNN â€“ Seismic Event Classification with Deep Learning

This repository is a **modified fork of the official STEAD (STanford EArthquake Dataset) repository**. The original contents of the forked repository have been relocated to the `INFO/` directory. The current focus of this project is the **classification of seismic waveform data** into four categories: `Noise`, `Low`, `Medium`, and `High` magnitude earthquakes using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Prerequisites

To fully utilize this repository on a local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Follow the setup instructions from the original STEAD repository** (see `INFO/`).
2. **Download and include the full STEAD dataset**:
   - Ensure the `<100GB>` `merged/` directory containing the full labeled dataset is placed in the root directory of this repo.

---

## Execution Workflow

Once the `merged/` directory is in place, run the following scripts **in order**:

### 1. `GenerateTVTSets.py`
- Parses data from the `merged/` directory.
- Generates PyTorch datasets and index files for `Noise`, `Low`, `Medium`, and `High` waveform examples used in this study.
- **Output**: TXT files of dataset splits.

### 2. `CNNGenerator.py`
- Trains the CNN model using predefined hyperparameters.
- **Training time** (on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti): ~1.7 hours per model over 10 epochs.
- **Output**: Trained weights saved as `seismo_cnn_weights.pth`.

### 3. `CNNRun.py`
- Loads the trained model from `seismo_cnn_weights.pth`.
- Evaluates performance on the testing set.
- **Output**: Evaluation results printed to terminal and saved in `FinalEvaluationPrintout.txt`.
